I recently completed a web development project where I designed and developed a responsive website using React JS, with a focus on learning and implementing essential concepts within the React framework. The main objective of the project was to build a GPT-3 website, and I took design inspiration from a Figma layout to create an engaging user interface.

The website features a navigation bar with several sections, including Home, What is GPT-3, Open AI, Case Studies, Library, and also provides Sign-in and Sign-up buttons. I organized the sections into separate components within the React application for better code structure and maintainability. To accomplish this, I utilized the useState hook to manage state within the components effectively.

For the user interface styling, I utilized CSS to apply custom styles to each page, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive design. The responsive design approach allows the website to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

By creating separate folders for components and containers, I followed best practices to manage the project's codebase efficiently. This modular approach enabled me to work on different parts of the website independently, making development and future updates more straightforward and manageable.

Throughout the development process, I gained hands-on experience in React concepts like useState, component creation, and component-based architecture. These essential skills helped me build a dynamic and interactive website, enriching my understanding of React and frontend web development as a whole.

Overall, the project served as an excellent learning experience, allowing me to apply my knowledge of React while building a practical and visually appealing GPT-3 website. I am excited to further enhance my skills and continue working on challenging projects in the future.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
